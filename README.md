# Bank Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the bank understand its customer base more effectively by providing insights into customer demographics, account balances, and onboarding trends. It highlights the total number of customers and their cumulative balance, giving the bank a snapshot of its current customer portfolio. The joining date slicer allows the analysis of customer acquisition trends over time, which can help assess the effectiveness of marketing and onboarding strategies.

By visualizing customers by gender, age, and job classification, the bank can identify key customer segments and tailor its services or campaigns accordingly. The view of new customers joining each month helps track growth patterns and seasonal trends in account openings. Additionally, the balance distribution by region supports regional performance analysis, helping the bank identify areas with high or low deposit concentrations.

The list of top 10 customers by balance helps highlight high-value clients, enabling relationship managers to focus on customer retention and personalized services. Overall, the dashboard supports data-driven decisions for improving customer engagement, optimizing product offerings, and driving business growth.
